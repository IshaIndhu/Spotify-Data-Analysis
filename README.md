# Spotify-Data-Analysis
A Scala implementation

## Introduction 

As a part of one of our courses ; Big Data Analytics, we have completed a project in which we have analysed the various features such as danceability,popularity and valence.
In this project, we have focussed majorly on the following four decades:
80s : 1980-1990
90s : 1990-2000
Early 2ks : 2000-2010
Late 2ks : 2010 to present date
We are mainly interested in analysing how peopleâ€™s taste in music has evolved over these decades.



## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains more than 25 lakh songs collected from Spotify Web API. The features include song, artist, release date as well as some characteristics of song such as acousticness, danceability, loudness, tempo and so on. The date ranges from 1921 to 2020.
